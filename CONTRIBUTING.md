## Develop new features

We are always looking to add new features and enhancements to make Widgetbook better for everyone. Aligning with the maintainers on the proposed changes will save you time and effort. New features and enhancements are reviewed for good fit as not all ideas will be selected, so it's best to have discussion about the enhancement first. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Choose an [existing issue](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook/labels/enhancement) with the enhancement label or create a [new issue](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook/issues/new) if the feature you want to work on is not in the list.
1. Comment on the issue to let others know you are working on it.
1. [Submit a PR](#submitting-pr) with your changes.
